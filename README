== Blank Rails app

An alternative to the Rails command. Contains basic stuff such as user authentication, static pages etc. that you're most likely 
going to need in all of your applications.

== TODO when creating a new app

    * Run rake app:init to create config/database.yml and config/settings.yml. It also creates a users.yml fixture, with an
      appropriately salted password hash.
    * Run rake test to make sure all the tests pass. Do inform me if they don't ; )

== Static pages

Static pages is created as views in app/views/pages. A route (and the pages controller) maps /foo to these static pages. Creating app/views/pages/about.html.erb gives you /about.

The root of the app is by default app/views/pages/index.html.erb.

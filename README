== Blank Rails app

An alternative to the Rails command. Contains basic stuff that you're most likely going to need in all of your applications.

== TODO when creating a new app

    * Run rake app:init to create config/database.yml and config/settings.yml.
    * Change the password salt in config/settings.yml. Be sure to include "%s" somewhere in there, as that's where the password
      is inserted in the salt prior to hashing it. FYI: Changing this salt causes the tests to fail, as there's a users.yml fixture
      that uses a hashed password generated from the default 12345%12345 salt. I should probably fix this.

== Static pages

Static pages is created as views in app/views/pages. A route (and the pages controller) maps /foo to these static pages. Creating app/views/pages/about.html.erb gives you /about.

The root of the app is by default app/views/pages/index.html.erb.
